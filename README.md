## SS-Helper

## Features
1. Automatically downloads, extracts and runs System Informer without the need for installation.
2. Automatically downloads and runs the latest version of Avenge
3. Detects unsigned DLL injections and unsigned .exe files
4. Reads any Search results.txt file you put next to the program to detect unsigned files such as Binary, automatically for you.
5. Deletes all directories and files that are not being used in your SS automatically, with a SelfDestuct option at the end.
6. If duplicate results are detected when scanning unsigned files, they will only appear 1 time per console.
7. Gives you reminders for bypasses that you have to check manually, that are not included in SS Helper and Avenge.
8. If the program fails at any possible point, it will give a detailed error but will continue to run and complete all its checks.
9. As long as the program is using any files (such as sigcheck or system informer), they will be marked as "hidden" files, and deleted when you stop using them.
